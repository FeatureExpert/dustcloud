Welcome to our (outdated) repository for reverse engineering and rooting of the Xiaomi Smart Home Devices. We provide you methods how to root your device without opening it or breaking the warranty seal (on your own risk).

** This repository is outdated for most usecases! It was meant as a reference cloud emulation for Xiaomi devices. For vacuum robots, it has been now integrated in [Valetudo](https://valetudo.cloud/) **

You find more information about my projects here: [My Website](https://dontvacuum.me)
Technical information and teardowns about robots can be found here: [Robotinfo](https://robotinfo.dev)

# Outdated info
The (again outdated) documentation of the devices (photos, datasheets, uart logs, etc) was moved to a new repo [dustcloud-documentation](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud-documentation)

Please take a look at the (outdated) Dustcloud Wiki, which also contains instructions on how to root and flash your device: (https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud/wiki)
